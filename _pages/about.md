Welcome to my website!

I am a Postdoctoral Research Assistant at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), working with [Prof. Tamer Ba≈üar](https://tamerbasar.csl.illinois.edu) and his research group. My interests lie in the intersection of game theory, reinforcement learning, and control theory.

Before joining UIUC, I earned my Ph.D. from the University of Maryland, College Park, where I worked with [Prof. Nuno Martins](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~nmartins/) on learning in large multi-agent systems. I hold a B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Bilkent University (Ankara, Turkey).
