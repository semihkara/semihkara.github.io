Welcome to my website!

I am a Postdoctoral Research Assistant at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), working with [Prof. Tamer Ba≈üar](https://tamerbasar.csl.illinois.edu) and his research group.

My interests lie in the intersection of game theory, reinforcement learning, and control theory. Currently, I am working on problems related to reinforcement learning in symmetric games, partially observed environments (with applications to finance), and Stackelberg games.

Before joining UIUC, I earned my Ph.D. from the University of Maryland, College Park, where I worked with [Prof. Nuno Martins](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~nmartins/) on [learning in large multi-agent systems](https://www.proquest.com/openview/4826de49cef5e3cfe4432fe2ce9c3869/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y). I hold a B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Bilkent University (Ankara, Turkey).
